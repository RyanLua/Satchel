Satchel is a modern open-source alternative to Roblox's default backpack. Satchel aims to be more customizable and easier to use than the default backpack while still having a "vanilla" feel. Installation of Satchel is as simple as dropping the module into your game and setting up a few properties if you like to customize it. It has a familiar feel and structure as to the default backpack for ease of use for both developers and players.
