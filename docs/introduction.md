## Satchel over Default

While the default backpack does its job, customizing the UI or editing the script is extremely difficult. Did you know that the backpack they are using today is from 2015? (With lots of bandaids and patches of course.) Satchel acts as a modernized version that aims to be much more friendly while still maintaining as many features and compatibility.

## CoreGui Relation

From a scripting perspective, Satchel is more of an advanced fork of the CoreGui with Satchel borrowing a majority of its codebase from the default. It's not entirely copy and paste job though. Type annotations and performance optimizations set Satchel apart along with its number of UI tweaks and refactors in place.
