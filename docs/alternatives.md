Satchel isn't the best backpack system out there or the only one but it does offer some advantages against others.

## Purse

[Purse] is a sub project of Satchel and a fork on the CoreGui backpack. It tries to be as close as possible to the default backpack while Satchel tries to be an improvement over it.

- Well documented
- Full platform support

### Cons

- Requires scripting knowledge to customize
- No new features over default backpack

## NeoHotbar

[Neobar] is a modern hotbar-only system that acts as a great alternative to Satchel if you are looking for a hotbar only. Made on a strong foundation and well-built, [Neobar] is a powerful tool with unparalleled customization and API.
